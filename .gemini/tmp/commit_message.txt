refactor: Update unit tests after authorization service simplification

This commit refactors several unit tests in the backend Application layer to align with the simplification of the authorization service.

Key changes include:
- Removing redundant `_mockAuthorizationService` instances from test classes where the authorization logic is now handled differently.
- Adjusting test methods that previously checked for unauthenticated users or missing user profiles, as these checks are now integrated into the authorization service itself or handled at a higher level.
- Deleting `src/backend/tests/Application.UnitTests/Members/Queries/GetEditableMembers/GetEditableMembersQueryHandlerTests.cs` which is no longer relevant due to changes in how editable members are determined.
