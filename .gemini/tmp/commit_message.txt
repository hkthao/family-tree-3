feat: Standardize error handling, implement auditable entities, and refine FaceController responses

This commit introduces several improvements across the backend:

- **Standardized Error Handling:** Replaced hardcoded error messages with `ErrorMessages` and `ErrorSources` constants for consistent and localized error reporting across various application handlers (Members, NotificationTemplates, Relationships, UserActivities, UserPreferences).
- **Auditable Entities:** Implemented `AuditableEntitySaveChangesInterceptor` to automatically populate `CreatedBy`, `Created`, `LastModifiedBy`, and `LastModified` fields for entities inheriting from `BaseAuditableEntity`. This enhances data integrity and traceability.
- **Refined FaceController Responses:** Modified `FaceController` endpoints to return `BadRequest` with detailed error messages when operations fail, providing clearer feedback to API consumers.
- **Unit Test Alignment:** Updated relevant unit tests to reflect the new error handling mechanisms and ensure continued test coverage and correctness.
