feat(backend): Implement Story Memory feature backend scaffold

This commit implements the backend scaffold for the AI Memorial Studio's Story Memory
sub-feature, following the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and DDD
(Domain-Driven Design) architectural patterns.

Key changes include:
- **Entities:**
  - `Memory.cs`: Defines the Memory entity, inheriting from `BaseAuditableEntity` and implementing `IAggregateRoot` and `ISoftDelete`.
  - `PhotoAnalysisResult.cs`: Defines the PhotoAnalysisResult entity, inheriting from `BaseAuditableEntity` and implementing `IAggregateRoot`.
- **Service Interfaces (`Application/Common/Interfaces`):**
  - `IPhotoAnalysisService.cs`: Interface for photo analysis.
  - `IStoryGenerationService.cs`: Interface for story generation.
  - (Note: `IMemoryService.cs` was removed as core CRUD operations are now handled by MediatR commands/queries).
- **Service Implementations (`Infrastructure/Services`):**
  - `PhotoAnalysisService.cs`: Implements `IPhotoAnalysisService` for n8n integration.
  - `StoryGenerationService.cs`: Implements `IStoryGenerationService` for n8n integration.
- **DTOs (`Application/Memories/DTOs`):**
  - `AnalyzePhotoRequestDto`, `PhotoAnalysisResultDto`, `GenerateStoryRequestDto`, `GenerateStoryResponseDto`, `CreateMemoryDto`, `UpdateMemoryDto`, `MemoryDto`.
- **MediatR Commands & Queries (`Application/Memories/Commands`, `Application/Memories/Queries`):**
  - `CreateMemoryCommand`, `UpdateMemoryCommand`, `DeleteMemoryCommand`, `AnalyzePhotoCommand`, `GenerateStoryCommand` (and their handlers and validators).
  - `GetMemoryDetailQuery`, `GetMemoriesByMemberIdQuery` (and their handlers).
- **Controller (`Web/Controllers`):**
  - `MemoriesController.cs`: Implements API endpoints using MediatR to dispatch commands and queries for all Memory-related operations.
- **Database Context (`Infrastructure/Data`):**
  - `IApplicationDbContext.cs`: Added `DbSet<Memory>` and `DbSet<PhotoAnalysisResult>`.
  - `ApplicationDbContext.cs`: Implemented `DbSet<Memory>` and `DbSet<PhotoAnalysisResult>`.
- **AutoMapper Profile (`Application/Memories`):**
  - `MemoryMappingProfile.cs`: Configures mappings between entities, commands, and DTOs.
- **Dependency Injection (`Infrastructure/DependencyInjection.cs`):**
  - Registered new services for `IPhotoAnalysisService` and `IStoryGenerationService`.
  - Configured `N8nSettings` in `appsettings.json` (via `N8nSettings.cs`).
- **Project File (`Application/Application.csproj`):**
  - Added `<FrameworkReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.App" />` for `IFormFile` resolution.
- **Removed `IMemoryService.cs` and `MemoryService.cs`:** Their functionality is now directly handled by MediatR handlers interacting with the database context.

This commit establishes the foundational backend services and API for managing AI-generated memories and photo analysis results.
