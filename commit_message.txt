fix(EventListView): Ensure advanced search filters are applied and loaded

Corrects the advanced search functionality in `EventListView.vue` by directly
updating `eventStore.list.filters` and triggering a data reload (`eventStore._loadItems()`)
when filters or search query change. This resolves the issue where `currentFilters`
and `eventStore.list.filters` were not synchronizing correctly.

Key changes:
- In `handleFilterUpdate`, directly updates `list.value.filters` and calls `eventStore._loadItems()`.
- In `handleSearchUpdate`, directly updates `list.value.filters.searchQuery` and calls `eventStore._loadItems()`.
- The local `currentFilters` ref in `EventListView.vue` is effectively bypassed, with direct interaction with the store's filters.
