feat(backend): Update and refactor backend tests for improved coverage and consistency

This commit addresses the request to update and refactor all backend tests, ensuring consistency across test frameworks and improving overall test coverage.

Key changes include:
- Migrated all NUnit/Shouldly tests to xUnit/FluentAssertions for a unified testing framework.
- Added comprehensive unit tests for Family CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) including validators and handlers.
- Fixed compilation errors in application code related to Family entity properties and nullability.
- Resolved ambiguous references to NotFoundException by explicitly specifying the correct namespace.
- Refactored IntegrationTestBase to be compatible with xUnit, temporarily disabling Testcontainers.MongoDb for compilation.
- Cleaned up project dependencies in .csproj and Directory.Packages.props files.
- Moved misplaced test file `CreateRelationshipCommandValidatorTests.cs` to its correct location and refactored it.
- Updated `run-coverage.sh` script to set coverage threshold to 75%.

All unit and integration tests are now passing with a running MongoDB instance.
