Create a Vue.js component using Vuetify 3 and TypeScript for a "MemberForm". The component should include:

A v-tabs component with two tabs: "Thông Tin Chung" (General Information) and "Dòng Thời Gian" (Timeline).

The first tab's content should be a form containing: chứa form MemberForm đang có sẵn 

The second tab's content should be a v-timeline component.

The timeline should have several v-timeline-item elements to represent life events (e.g., birth, marriage), with each item containing a v-card for details.
