You are an expert ASP.NET Core developer specializing in DDD and CQRS architecture.

Task: Generate a backend module to integrate the existing ASP.NET Core genealogy app with an external **Python Face Detection Service**.

Requirements:

1. **Module Name:** FaceIntegration
2. **Architecture:** DDD + CQRS
3. **Responsibilities:**
   - Call the external Face Detection Service (FastAPI + MTCNN) via HTTP
   - Send uploaded member or group images to the service
   - Receive JSON response containing:
     - Detected faces: bounding boxes, confidence scores, base64 thumbnails
   - Expose CQRS commands and queries:
     - `DetectFacesCommand` → handle file upload, call Python service, store temporary results
     - `GetDetectedFacesQuery` → retrieve list of detected faces for frontend labeling
     - `LabelFaceCommand` → assign detected face to a Member entity or create a new member
4. **Data Handling:**
   - Use **DTOs** for communication between layers
   - Temporary storage of detected faces (before user labeling)
   - After labeling, persist face metadata to `MemberFaces` table:
     - MemberId, FaceId, BoundingBox, Thumbnail, CreatedAt
5. **API Endpoints (ASP.NET Core Controllers):**
   - `POST /api/faces/detect` → accept image, call Python service, return detected faces
   - `GET /api/faces/detected/{imageId}` → return list of detected faces for UI labeling
   - `POST /api/faces/label` → save labeled face data
6. **CQRS & DDD:**
   - Commands handled in `Application.Faces.Commands`
   - Queries handled in `Application.Faces.Queries`
   - Domain entities updated in `Domain.Members` or `Domain.Faces` aggregate
   - Inject services using DI, follow clean architecture
7. **Error Handling:**
   - Handle Python service errors (timeout, invalid response)
   - Return meaningful API errors to frontend
8. **Logging & Tracing:**
   - Log API calls to Python service
   - Track which user uploaded/assigned faces
9. **Other Requirements:**
   - Async/await usage for HTTP calls
   - Use strongly-typed HTTP clients
   - Fully documented, maintainable, modular code

**Output:** Provide a detailed module design (folders, services, commands, queries, DTOs, and controller endpoints) ready to be generated by Gemini CLI. Focus on **integration between ASP.NET Core DDD/CQRS app and Python face detection service**. Do not include UI code.
